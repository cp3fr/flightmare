The file formatting is generally the same as described in the `README` in the root folder, but file names also include the maximum time that the simulation was run for (`mt-{XY}` is a maximum time of X.Y seconds) and there is a file of the entire trajectory flown by the MPC (`trajectory_mpc_eval_nw.csv`).

Additionally, the training settings are included in `dagger_settings.yaml`. The main missing parameter (now added to the most recent version on the `master` branch) is `max_time`, which specifies the maximum time that the simulation was run for data generation/training of the DDA architecture, which was 3 seconds. The maximum time for testing (as you can see, 7 seconds) is higher in order to see whether the model generalises well beyond the "expected data distribution".
