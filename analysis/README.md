## Data for initial analysis of network performance 

The model weights used to generate the data are stored under `2021-01-31_21-13-36_resnet-larger-fm-mpc-60-20-da` and the checkpoint after the first epoch is used.

The `logs` folder currently contains the original reference trajectory `trajectory_reference_original.csv` (subject 16, run 5, flat track, lap 1), the MPC-generated trajectory `trajectory_reference_mpc.csv` (tracking the former), and a number of trajectories generated by first letting the MPC control the quadcopter for `X.Y` seconds (where the pattern is `trajectory_mpc2nw_switch-XY_REP.csv`) and then switching over to the network. 

All files contain the following columns: 
- `time-since-start [s]`
- `position_x [m]`, `position_y [m]`, `position_z [m]` (where the x-axis is along the long side of the arena, the y-axis along the short side and the z-axis points upwards)
- `rotation_w [quaternion]`, `rotation_x [quaternion]`, `rotation_y [quaternion]`, `rotation_z [quaternion]`
- `velocity_x [m/s]`, `velocity_y [m/s]`, `velocity_z [m/s]`

In addition, the generated trajectories (by MPC or network) also contain the actions at each time step (`throttle`, `roll`, `pitch`, and `yaw`), as well as a flag indicating whether the network was used (`network_used`).

**NOTE:** The gate positions in Flightmare are 0.35m above those in the original dataset (i.e. at 2.1m). Since `trajectory_reference_original.csv` is taken directly from the original dataset, the actual value for the z-position in the Flightmare simulation should be `position_z [m] + 0.35` (this is adjusted in code right now).  


## Log filenames

In separate folders logfile ouputs are saved from different model evaluations online (network in control) and offline (mpc in control)

.csv filenames:

`mt` : maximum time, the the maximum time that the simulation was run for data generation/training of the DDA architecture, which was 3 seconds. The maximum time for testing (as you can see, 7 seconds) is higher in order to see whether the model generalises well beyond the "expected data distribution".

`st` : switch time, time after start at which the network takes control, two digit numbers, e.g. 15, referring to 1.5 seconds

`if` : image frequency, at what frequency the images were sampled, i.e. 60, refers to 60 Hz

`cf` : control frequency, at what frequency the control commands were sampled, i.e. 20, refers to 20 Hz

last number is the trial number
